This folder contains 6 files and has implementation of 4 types of tree algorithms:
1) BST
2) AVL
3) Splay
4) Treaps

First three uses TreeNode as the default class for left and right childs, plus the height of each node.
Fourth once uses its own class called as Treap Node which handles the priority of every node as well.

To Run,

Just execute the file as it is, as main function is defined in each file and 
the random values are taken as defined in TreeNode.java in the total variable using random() library.

All the operation such as insert, search and delete have been implemented with create function is called as 
a constructor to each class.
